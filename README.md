This app removes the "Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\System\GameConfigStore\Children" and "Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\System\GameConfigStore\Parents" registry keys 
for improving the gaming performance on Windows 10/11 OSes. And it applies to remove registry key processes per 5 seconds when this program has opened. 
So, it loops removing GameConfig/Children and GameConfig/Parents registry keys per 5 seconds. It runs on background too.

Only open this program and play without any config issues :)
